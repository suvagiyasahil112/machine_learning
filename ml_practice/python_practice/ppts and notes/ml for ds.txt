ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
1. Linear Regression
For predicting continuous values (e.g., housing prices).

Simple but foundational.

2. Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification problems (e.g., spam or not spam).

Also works for multi-class (with softmax/multinomial logistic regression).

3. Decision Trees
Easy to interpret.

Good for both classification and regression.

4. Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees.

Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

5. Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
High performance in structured/tabular data.

Commonly used in Kaggle competitions.

6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Powerful for high-dimensional data.

Effective in text classification and image recognition.

7. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Simple and non-parametric.

Useful for classification tasks with small datasets.

ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning
8. K-Means Clustering
Groups data into clusters based on similarity.

Great for segmentation tasks.

9. Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a hierarchy of clusters.

Useful for exploring data structures.

10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Dimensionality reduction technique.

Helps in visualization and noise reduction.

ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks & Deep Learning
11. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Basic form of deep learning.

Handles complex nonlinear relationships.

12. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Best for image data.

Used in computer vision tasks.

13. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, GRU
Best for sequence/time-series data.

Used in NLP, forecasting, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Reinforcement Learning (Introductory)
14. Q-Learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
Good to know the basics if you're going into areas like robotics or game AI.
