# You are working on a simple image processing task. The image is represented as a 2D grayscale matrix,
#  where each value is the pixel intensity (0 for black, 255 for white).

#  Perform basic operations on this "image."

# Create a 5x5 NumPy array where pixel values are random integers between 0 and 255.

# Normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.

# Identify the positions of the brightest pixels (value > 0.8 after normalization).

# Identify the positions of the darkest pixels (value < 0.2 after normalization).

# Pixels with values â‰¥ 0.5 are set to 1 (white).

# Pixels with values < 0.5 are set to 0 (black).

# Horizontally (left-to-right).

# Vertically (top-to-bottom).

# Add random noise (values between -0.1 and 0.1) to the normalized array
#  and clip the values to stay within [0, 1].

# Create a 3x3 kernel filter and apply convolution to blur the image.

# Save the final processed image to a file.
